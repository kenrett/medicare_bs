1. Get the Gtest.all into seeds.rb

2. Create new view called whatever I want: index.html.erb  (9.38)

(Instead of new.html.erb)

3. Do it as a table, instead of a dropdown... Has a row for each test.

4. Render the complete contents of the db into an html table

5. Add a script tag to the erb that has javascript that will look at the whole table and construct

Hook up the page so that if a user clicks on one of the tests, 

the javascript needs to not only get the test names, but the ranges

While building, have them showing on the page. once they're ready, style display: none

js is also going to have to create the link AND the handler for those links
